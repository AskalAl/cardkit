# CardKit v2

## Version 2.0.0-alpha

### 2015 [Chris Hutchinson](http://www.github.com/chrishutchinson) for The [Times and Sunday Times](http://www.github.com/times)

CardKit v2 is flexible, SVG image / card creation tool, with simple configuration options, which is easy to extend.

![CardKit Usage](http://fat.gfycat.com/FoolhardyGaseousCockroach.gif)

CardKit is aimed at newsrooms, however has many potential uses that extend beyond that:

- Coupon and offer images
- Templated asset generation
- Video preview images (e.g. 16:9)
- Marketing and promotion
- Personal branding

_This is a rebuild of the current CardKit, available on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/times/cardkit) (forked from [voxmedia/meme](http://www.github.com/voxmedia/meme)), using Angular JS and SVG (rather than canvas)._
