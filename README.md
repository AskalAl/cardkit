# CardKit v2

A flexible, SVG share card creation tool, with simple configuration options, which is easy to extend.

This is a rebuild of the current CardKit, available on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/times/cardkit) (forked from [voxmedia/meme](http://www.github.com/voxmedia/meme)), using Angular JS and SVG (rather than canvas).
